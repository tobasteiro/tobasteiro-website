# TOBasteiro Website

## My Personal Space

I created this website, not just to share content, ideas and problems that I've faced throughout my career, but also as a space that I can experiment with full freedom new technologies and tools.

## Local environment

For this website, I decided to use NextJS to get the best of server components combined with ReactJS.

```bash
# Install dependencies:
yarn install

# Run development server:
yarn run dev
```
